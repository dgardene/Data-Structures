1. Big O of finding the indegree of each vertex O(v+e)
2. Big O of the determining the critical path O(v)
3. Big O of the topological sort that tracks the maximum path lengths and critical path O(v+e)
4. Big O of the overall storage requirements for the topological sort that tracks the
   maximum path lengths and critical path O(|V|+|E|)
