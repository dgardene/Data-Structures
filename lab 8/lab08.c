TEST CASES AND STATUS:

1. undirected graph file graph.txt â€“ passed
2. directed graph file - failed


1. Big O of building the adjacency list in terms of number of vertices V and edges E is O(|v| + |e|)
2. Big O of the storage requirements for the adjacency list is O(|v| + |e|)
3. Big O of the storage needs for the breadth or depth first search as given in the chapter
   13 lecture slides is O(v)
